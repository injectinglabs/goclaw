description: Bulk-enrich rows in a user's Google Sheet — fill out one or more columns by running a single orchestrator workflow. Use when the user asks to "enrich my sheet", "research these companies in my spreadsheet", "fill in CEO/LinkedIn/funding for each row", "find data for every row in column A", or similar multi-row research-and-fill requests over a Google Sheet they have access to.

# Sheet Bulk Enrich

A playbook for filling many cells in a user's Google Sheet via the Sheet Workflows orchestrator. The orchestrator handles DAG planning, per-cell retry, batching, and live progress on its own — your job is to gather the schema, kick it off, and report results.

## When to trigger

Activate this skill when the user asks to populate or enrich data in a Google Sheet they own. Typical phrasings:
- "Enrich my sheet 'Q3 Prospects' — for each company find CEO, LinkedIn, last funding"
- "Fill column C with the LinkedIn URL for each person in column B"
- "Research every row in my spreadsheet and add summary in D"
- "For each ticker in column A, get current price + 1-line news in B and C"

If the user just wants to read a sheet or write a few cells, do NOT use this skill — use `mcp_composio_mcp__GOOGLESHEETS_VALUES_GET` / `GOOGLESHEETS_VALUES_UPDATE` directly.

## Architecture (so you pick the right tools)

The Sheet Workflows pipeline runs entirely on the user's existing Composio Google connection — no second OAuth prompt:

- **You (the agent)** — use composio's `GOOGLESHEETS_*` / `GOOGLEDRIVE_*` actions for sheet *setup* (create, search, append, get info).
- **`sheets_enrich_run`** (the one tool from sheets-mcp) — the *entry point* to the orchestrator. You build a column schema and call this once.
- **Orchestrator (server-side)** — reads the input range via composio, fans out cell-executor LLM calls in waves (DAG by `depends_on`), retries failures with exponential backoff, and writes cell values back through composio's `GOOGLESHEETS_VALUES_UPDATE`. Emits `workflow.event` over WS for live progress.

Never call sheets-mcp's old per-cell tools (status / read / update / batch_update) — those are retired. Use composio for ad-hoc cell ops, sheets_enrich_run for bulk.

## Critical do-NOTs (read these first, save you 60+ seconds per run)

- **Do NOT pass `user_id` to `sheets_enrich_run`.** It's now OPTIONAL and the tool resolves the user itself from the `X-Actor-User-ID` header goclaw injects on every MCP call. If you pass it, it's ignored; if you don't, the tool works. Either way: do NOT spend tool budget hunting for a user UUID in the filesystem, in `session_status`, or anywhere else.
- **Do NOT call `GOOGLESHEETS_VALUES_UPDATE` after `sheets_enrich_run`.** The orchestrator writes cells to the sheet itself, through composio, with retry + waves. Manually writing values means YOU are racing against the orchestrator and overwriting cells it's about to fill. If you don't see immediate values, the orchestrator is still running (waves take 5–20 s for typical 20-cell sheets) — do NOT panic-write.
- **Do NOT poll `GOOGLESHEETS_VALUES_GET` to check progress.** The tool returns `run_id` immediately; the orchestrator publishes `workflow.event` on the WS bus when each wave flushes. Sit back and tell the user the run started. The final sheet reflects the run when it completes.
- **`target_col` IS respected.** If the schema says column B for `country`, the orchestrator writes B. If the test reveals otherwise, it's a real bug — report instead of working around with manual updates.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify in this order:

1. **Composio Google connected** — call `mcp_composio_mcp__GOOGLESHEETS_GET_SPREADSHEET_INFO` on any test id to confirm. If composio returns "no connection", tell the user to connect Google in `/integrations` and STOP. Do NOT prompt for a separate sheets-mcp connect — that path is retired.
2. **Spreadsheet identified** —
   - If the user named the sheet, find it with `mcp_composio_mcp__GOOGLESHEETS_SEARCH_SPREADSHEETS`. If multiple match, ask which one.
   - If they pasted a URL, extract the spreadsheet_id (the long alphanumeric segment between `/d/` and the next `/`).
   - If they have no sheet yet ("create a new one with X"), create it with `mcp_composio_mcp__GOOGLEDRIVE_CREATE_FILE_FROM_TEXT` (mime `application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet`) or whatever Composio create action is available. Then add the header row + seed rows with `mcp_composio_mcp__GOOGLESHEETS_SPREADSHEETS_VALUES_APPEND`.
3. **Schema confirmed** — call `mcp_composio_mcp__GOOGLESHEETS_GET_SPREADSHEET_INFO` to learn tab names + row/col counts. Show the user a one-line summary (`Sheet1 — 47 rows × 6 cols`) and confirm the right tab + which column has the "key" data they want to enrich from.

## Building the column schema

For each output column the user wants filled, build a spec:
- **id** — short stable identifier (e.g. `ceo`, `linkedin`, `funding`).
- **name** — human-readable header that will appear in the sheet.
- **target_col** — A1 column letter the orchestrator writes to (e.g. `B`, `C`).
- **type** — `text` / `number` / `url` / `email`.
- **prompt** — one short sentence stating what to put in this column for ONE row, using the row's known data as input. Reference other columns by their id with `{ceo}`-style placeholders the orchestrator will substitute. Example: `"Given a company name in {Company}, return the current CEO's full name. Return ONLY the name, nothing else."`
- **depends_on** — list of other output column **ids** whose value this prompt needs. E.g. column `linkedin` depends on `["ceo"]` because finding the URL needs the name. The orchestrator topologically sorts waves by this.

Confirm the schema with the user before running. Show a compact table:

```
| id        | Header        | Col | Type | Depends on |
| ceo       | CEO           |  B  | text | (none)     |
| linkedin  | CEO LinkedIn  |  C  | url  | ceo        |
| funding   | Last funding  |  D  | text | (none)     |
```

## Execution

ONE call to `sheets_enrich_run` kicks the whole thing off. Example arguments:

```jsonc
{
  "user_id":        "<provided by goclaw>",
  "spreadsheet_id": "1AbcDEf...XyZ",
  "sheet_tab":      "Sheet1",
  "input_range":    "Sheet1!A2:A48",
  "workflow_name":  "Q3 Prospects — CEO + LinkedIn + funding",
  "columns": [
    { "id": "ceo",      "name": "CEO",          "target_col": "B", "type": "text",
      "prompt": "Given a company name in {Company}, return the current CEO's full name. Return ONLY the name.",
      "depends_on": [] },
    { "id": "linkedin", "name": "CEO LinkedIn", "target_col": "C", "type": "url",
      "prompt": "Given CEO name {ceo} and company {Company}, return the CEO's LinkedIn profile URL.",
      "depends_on": ["ceo"] },
    { "id": "funding",  "name": "Last funding", "target_col": "D", "type": "text",
      "prompt": "Given company {Company}, return the most recent funding round as 'Series X, $Y, YYYY-MM'.",
      "depends_on": [] }
  ]
}
```

The tool returns a `run_id` immediately. Cells fill in asynchronously over the next 30s–few minutes depending on row count.

## What happens server-side (so your reporting is accurate)

- Orchestrator reads `input_range` via composio, builds a DAG from `depends_on`, and runs in waves.
- Per cell: one LLM call (the tenant's chat provider) using the column `prompt` with row context substituted.
- Per cell write: one composio `GOOGLESHEETS_VALUES_UPDATE` call. Retries on transient failure (3 attempts, exp backoff).
- Live events: `workflow.event` on WS — `cell.started`, `cell.completed`, `cell.failed`, `wave.flushed`, `run.completed`.

## Reporting

After `sheets_enrich_run` returns:
- Tell the user the run kicked off and link the spreadsheet. Example: `Run started (run_id: …). 47 rows × 3 cols queued — watch the sheet, cells will fill in as the orchestrator works through them. I'll let you know when it's done.`
- If the user stays in chat, the WS events will surface in the SheetMessageBubble (live preview). If not, the final `run.completed` event will mark this turn done.
- On `run.completed`: one-line summary `Done — 47 rows × 3 columns enriched. 3 cells had no source (empty).` + 1-3 example rows.

## Error handling

| Failure | Action |
|---|---|
| `not_connected` from `sheets_enrich_run` | Composio Google not connected. STOP, tell user to connect Google in `/integrations`. |
| Empty rows in input_range | Tool returns with row_indices=[]. Tell the user no rows had a key value. |
| `run.failed` event with auth error | Composio token revoked. Same fix as above. |
| `cell.failed` events for some rows | Report them in the summary; offer "want me to retry the failed cells with a broader search?" |
| User cancels mid-run | Goclaw run will mark itself cancelled on next wave boundary; report what completed. |

## What to AVOID

- Do NOT call retired sheets-mcp tools (`sheets_status`, `sheets_get_connect_url`, `sheets_create_spreadsheet`, `sheets_append_rows`, `sheets_update_range`, `sheets_batch_update`, `sheets_set_cell_status`, `sheets_read_range`). They no longer exist. Use composio's `GOOGLESHEETS_*` and the one tool `sheets_enrich_run`.
- Do NOT loop manually issuing `GOOGLESHEETS_VALUES_UPDATE` per cell. Build the schema once, let the orchestrator do it.
- Do NOT spawn subagents per row yourself — the orchestrator already fans out and tracks each cell.
- Do NOT prompt the user to "connect Google Sheets" separately — Composio's Google connection is the single source of truth.
- Do NOT hallucinate values when sources are missing — the orchestrator returns empty for unreliable answers.
- Do NOT overwrite already-filled cells unless the user explicitly asked (orchestrator skips non-empty cells by default).
